Modules: (Mixins and Namespaces)

* What are we going to do?
= Learn how to add and share behavior across classes with Mixins.
= Learn how to avoid name conflicts in code bases.

* Why are we going to do this?
- We want one place to define a specific behavior that can
  be shared.
- Because we don't want to repeat a lot of code over and over in the
  code base.

- And we do *not* want class name conflicts

* How do this relate ?
We learned about Objects and Inheritence and but there are limitations
of using these ways to construct a coherent and easy to change code
base.
